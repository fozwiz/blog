# OH Blog

In case your blog entry is ready, put it in `publish` directory, it will appear in http://openhouse.sk/blog (via Jenkins and `build` script).

The blog entries are expected to be written in [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and have and `.md` extension.
The first two lines of a blog entry have to look like this:

    # Blog entry title
    ###### tag1 [, tag2, tag3, .. , tagN]

If you reference some code or other files in you blog entry, store them to appropriate directory (`code` or `files`).

You can have look at blog entries in `publish` directory to get an idea.
